NOTE: the provided Star Wars API was down at the time that I was implementing the data fetching, so I had to replace it with a mock implementation.

The Table component accepts the following props:

rows - the data to be rendered by the table, assumed to be an array of objects.

columns - an array of objects that define the table columns with the following properties:
    "label" - the value to display in the table header for the given column
    "selector" - the property on the row item in which the data for the column is located e.g. "name" or "address.street"
    "renderer" - an optional function which allows custom formatting of a particular table cell
    "sort" - an optional function that allows for custom sorting of a given column. Users lodash.orderby by default

loading - boolean that controls the loading indicator

uniqueKeyField - allows the user to define the property to use as the "key" prop when mapping through the rows. Defaults to "id"
